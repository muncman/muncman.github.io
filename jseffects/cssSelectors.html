<h1>Using CSS Selectors</h1>
<h4>
  <span style="color: red;">Note that Internet Explorer does not really support CSS Selectors.</span>
  Firefox, Safari and Opera have <em>much</em> better support for these.
  They are CSS2 features. Internet Explorer version 7 is intended to have improved support, however.
  Note also that this upcoming improved support <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/09/css_hacks_are_s_1.html">will break many CSS hack techniques for IE</a> which work for previous versions of IE.
</h4>

<h3>Universal Selector</h3>
  <p>This uses an asterisk to select <strong>all</strong> elements in the page.</p>
  <p><span class="code">* { text-transform: lowercase; }</span> is used in this page.</p>

<h3>Normal Selection</h3>
  <p>Normal CSS selection includes these types:
    <ol>
      <li>identifier</li>
      <li>class</li>
      <li>element</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Identifier selection is done by specifying an id attribute value, prefixed with a # symbol,
    such as <br /><span class="code">#zLevelOne { background-color: red; z-index: 1; }</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Class selection is done by specifying a class attribute value, prefixed with a dot,
    such as <br /><span class="code">.stretch-words { word-spacing: 5mm; }</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Element selection is done by specifying an element, with no prefix,
    such as <br /><span class="code">body { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif; }</span>
  </p>
  <p>These technique work properly in Internet Explorer.</p>

<h3>Child Selector</h3>
  <p>You can target CSS styling by specifying elements which are direct children of other element types.</p>
  <div><p><span>This is text inside a span, inside a paragraph, inside a div.</p></div>
  <p>The style rule <span class="code">div > p > span { font-style: italic; }</span> is applied here.</p>

<h3>Adjacent Sibling Selector</h3>
  <p>You can also target styling to elements which are direct siblings of other elements.</p>
  <p><span>For example, </span><em>this is text inside an em, which is right next to a span in the source.</em></p>
  <p>The style rule <span class="code">span + em { text-decoration: underline; }</span> is applied here.</p>
  <p>
    Notice that this rule also caught the emphasized &quot;much&quot; in the text at the top of the page,
    where the span and em are separated by other unmarked-up text.
  </p>

<h3>Attribute Selector</h3>
  <p>You can target styling by limiting it to elements with certain attributes defined.</p>
  <p myAttribute="myValue">
    Here's a paragraph with a custom attribute called <span class="code">myAttribute</span>.
    There is an in-page CSS style definition for it, as follows: <span class="code">p[myAttribute] { background-color: orange; }</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that, at least in Firefox, you can even select based on the value of the attribute.
    For example, <span class="code">p[myAttribute=&quot;myValue&quot;]</span> works as expected.
    Further, using ~=, you can specify the existence of at least the given value,
    such as if you have a paragraph with mutliple classes declared, one of which is &quot;targeted&quot;,
    you can use a selector like this <span class="code">p[class~=targeted]</span>
  </p>

<h3>Multiple Class Selection</h3>
  <p>Finally, you can also target styling to elements with a specific combination of classes.</p>
  <p>This technique seems to work properly, at least for the most part, in Internet Explorer.</p>
  <p class="spinal tap rules">This paragraph has these three classes declared: &quot;spinal tap rules&quot;</p>
  <p>The style rule <span class="code">p.spinal.tap.rules { text-tranform: uppercase; }</span> is applied here.</p>
  <p>Note that the order of the values is not important, and the target element can have more classes than are specified in the selector, as well.</p>
