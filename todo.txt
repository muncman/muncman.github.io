TODO:
      + Comprehensive cross-browser and cross-platform testing is out of date.
      + Opera is reloading CSS *after* JavaScript execution, re-hiding everything.
      + OmniWeb needs hidden/visible set to "hidden"/"visible"
        instead of "hide"/"show" as document.layers is true for it.
      + All the section widths could stand tweaking, according to browser agent.
      + It might be nice to make the onkeypress for the spacebar not shift the page down...
      + What about P3P-enabling the site??
          See http://www.w3.org/P3P/#Enable and http://www.w3.org/P3P/validator.html
      + Not everything is working (such as access keys) in Safari.
          Look into this more.
